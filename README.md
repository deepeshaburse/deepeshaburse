I'm Deepesha Burse, currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Business Systems at [Bharati Vidyapeeth, College of Engineering, Pune](https://bvuniversity.edu.in/). I have loved tech ever since I can remember, my first language was Java! Throughout my 2 years of college, I have explored Data Science, Web Development and basics of Cloud. Although still new to open-source, I am very fond of the culture and do my best to give back to a community that has given me so much! Outside of tech, I enjoy reading and listening to music.
